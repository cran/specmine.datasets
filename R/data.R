#' Human cachexia data
#'
#' Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with an underlying illness (such as cancer) 
#' and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass (Evans et al., 2008). 
#' A total of 77 urine samples were collected being 47 of them patients with cachexia, and 30 control patients.

#' Cassava Postharvest Physiological Deterioration
#'
#' Cassava is a root well known and widely cultivated in tropical and 
#' subtropical regions for its starchy tuberous root, which is a great 
#' source of carbohydrates. It also has a great variety of applications, 
#' like animal feeding, culinary or alcoholic beverages. In some countries, 
#' cassava has also been tested as an ethanol biofuel feedstock.

#' Brazilian Propolis from different Harvest Seasons and different Agroecological Regions (dataset)
#'
#' @description Propolis or bee glue is a sticky dark-colored substance produced 
#' from the collected buds or exudates of plants (resin) by bees 
#' (Apis mellifera L.). The resin is masticated, salivary enzymes are 
#' added, and the partially digested material is mixed with beewax 
#' and used in the hive to seal the walls, strengthen the borders of 
#' combs, and embalm dead invaders (Wollenweber et al., 1990).
#' The propolis samples are from NMR data and were collected in the 
#' autumn (AU), winter (WI), spring (SP), and summer (SM) of 2010 
#' from Apis mellifera hives located in southern Brazil (Santa 
#' Catarina State). A total of 59 samples were collected, and the 
#' distribution of samples by seasons being: SM - 16 samples, AU 
#' and SP - 15 samples, WI - 13 samples. Also, three agroecological 
#' regions were defined for the different apiaries, and one 
#' distributed as follows: Highlands - 12 samples, Plain - 11 samples, 
#' Plateau - 36 samples.
